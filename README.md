# Project developed for the Systems with Agents exam.

The project is divided into two environments:

* The website developed in HTML, PHP, JS, and CSS
* The app developed with Android Studio in Java

The website includes a homepage where all proposed stories, duly validated by an admin, will be visible. 
It is also possible to propose one's own story, after authentication, to be interactively told by the robot. In fact, it will be possible to divide the story into paragraphs, and each paragraph may include photos, videos, or colors.
